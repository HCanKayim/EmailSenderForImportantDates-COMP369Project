# EmailSenderForImportantDates-COMP369Project

Built a Python application that automates email reminders for important dates using smtplib, selenium, and crontab. Scraped event data into a JSON file, validated dates, and scheduled daily email dispatch via crontab. Resolved challenges like Gmail auth issues, duplicate data, and Turkish-English date conversion.
